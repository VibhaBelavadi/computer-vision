# Computer Vision projects

This repo contains the following two projects of Computer Vision course:

1. Implementation of basic Coputer Vision techniques
Performed Color conversion from Luv to xyY domain, coded Linear scaling and histogram equalization for a set of images.

2. Wink Detection:
Programmed/trained OpenCV to detect ‘shh expression’ (silence) and a ‘wink expression’ in images and live video using HAAR cascade classifiers.
