Approach:

In detect wink, we took mulitple cascades for eyes and the face. By doing median filtering we were able to get the cascades working on majority of the images.

In silence detection, by taking multiple cascades for the face and changing the rate of discovering the mouth,we were able to achieve a decent accuracy.
